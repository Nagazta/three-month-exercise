| Feature                       | Why It Helps                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backspace/Delete**          | Allows the user to correct input without clearing the whole expression |
| **Prevent multiple decimals** | Prevents input like `2..3` which breaks calculation                    |
| **Chained calculations**      | After result, allow new operation directly (e.g., `4 + 2 = 6 + 3 = 9`) |
| **Keyboard input support**    | Users can use keyboard for input, improving usability                  |

ðŸ§¼ UI/UX Improvements

| **Button spacing and styling**           | Use CSS grid gap or padding for cleaner button layout       |
| **Responsive design**                    | Make it usable on mobile devices too                        |
| **Highlight selected operator**          | Shows users which operator is active                        |
| **Better display area**                  | Show entire equation (`4 + 2`) above the result for context |
| **Dark/Light theme toggle** *(optional)* | Nice for practice and user customization                    |
